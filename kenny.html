        <img src="images/kennymap.jpg" alt="The island map of KENNYYYY! It has icons locating where each business on the island is and where each resident or villager lives. This map shows that the island of KENNYYYY! had three human residents and ten animal villagers.">
        <p>KENNYYY! was my very first Animal Crossing town -- EVER. Having never played the earlier games like City Folk and New Leaf, it took me a lot of time to get through the tutorial. I was also playing without time traveling, meaning I played without skipping forward or backward in time by changing the time on my Switch. Despite its chaotic (and kind of accidental) name, it is a peaceful generic storybook town, sprinkled with scenes inspired by Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, Howl's Moving Castle, and more.</p>

The area consists of a wooden entry bridge, wooden stalls at varying heights, a telephone pole, a telephone booth, a cotton candy stand, a lantern and a plant for some decoration.">

The suite has a red bed with white accents, a matching red and white sofa, and a red heart vanity.

            <img src="images/kennylobby.jpg" alt="My character is standing behind the desk in the the lobby of Nook Suites, KENNYYYY's premiere luxury hotel. She is wearing her uniform, a tan vest over a white dress shirt, a navy blue skirt and a tan wide-brim hat with a green band around it. The front desk is along the right wall of the room, with a carpeted waiting area with couches along the left wall.">
            <img src="images/kennyhotelroom.jpg" alt="Animal Crossing character standing in the basic suite of the hotel, which has two brown matching twin beds and warm brown furniture. Along the wall there is an old fashioned sewing machine, with a bronze plaque and two mounted fish in the wall behind it. In front of her is a cart serving up some carrot cake for the guests.">

            <p>KENNYYYY! had its very own inn & suites! It was complete with 3 different rooms, a seaside cafe, and a banquet hall. Each room is a different tier, with basic, deluxe, and luxury units. The room pictured above is the basic double room. The deluxe suite is equipped with a King bed and a luxurious marble bathroom. Upstairs, the luxury suite is equipped with a living room, a mini kitchen, a king bed and a large bathroom with a whirpool jacuzzi tub. You can see the complete hotel at my Dream Address above!</p>

            <p class=centertext>I also made a spooky witch-themed area.</p>

            <p>To this day, KENNYYYY! has some of my favorite landscaping choices. I was totally freestyling it since it was my first island, it ended up being the island I terraformed the most out of my islands so far. Overall, this island was SO much fun to make, but I reached a point where it felt like I had added all that I could. Before I restarted my island, however, I did save it to a Dream Address, allowing anyone with the code to visit. There is so much more to KENNYYYY! to see what is pictured here, so you are welcome to visit in-game via dream!</p>
