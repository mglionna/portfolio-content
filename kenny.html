"KENNYYY! was my very first Animal Crossing town -- EVER. Having never played the earlier games like City Folk and New Leaf, it took me a lot of time to get through the tutorial. I was also playing without time traveling, meaning I played without skipping forward or backward in time by changing the time on my Switch."

"KENNYYYY!, despite its chaotic (and kind of accidental) name, it is a peaceful generic storybook town, sprinkled with scenes inspired by Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, Howl’s Moving Castle, and more."

"I especially loved the section inspired by Alice in Wonderland…"

"KENNYYYY! also had its very own inn & suites! It was complete with 3 different rooms, a seaside cafe, and a banquet hall."

"To this day, KENNYYYY! has some of my favorite landscaping choices. I was totally freestyling it since it was my first island, it ended up being the island I terraformed the most out of my islands so far."

"Overall, this island was SO much fun to make, but I reached a point where it felt like I had added all that I could. Before I restarted my island, however, I did save it to a Dream Address, allowing anyone with the code to visit. There is so much more to KENNYYYY! to see than what is pictured here, so you are welcome to visit in-game via dream!"
