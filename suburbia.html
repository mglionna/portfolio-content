            <p>Suburbia is my third and most recent island, and by far my favorite so far! As I will mention below, the infamous Version 2.0 update brought a TON of new features that made the game even more enjoyable.</p>       
            
            <img src="images/suburbiapool.jpg" alt="My character is standing on the wooden pool deck of her house. She is wearing a green robe with her new favorite hairstyle, an orange curly bun. The pool is a bean shape and is lined with white tiles on the edges. On the other side of the character is a white patio table with an umbrella.">
            <img src="images/suburbiadriveway.jpg" alt="My character is standing in front of her white and teal house with a pink roof. She is wearing a bandana with a curly bun and a fun green apron. To her right is a pink car in her driveway."> 
            <img src="images/suburbiacarnival.jpg" alt="My character standing in front of Suburbia's carnival area. It has an ATM to the left of her, a dunk game booth behind her, and a merry-go-round behind her to the right."> <!-- ADD ALT TEXT -->
            
            <p>One of my favorite features of the 2.0 update is that it brought in my new FAVORITE hairstyle! I finally got a hairstyle that looked like my natural curly hair texture. Over its lifetime, ACNH developers have steadily improved the inclusivity of the game by introducing hairstyles, clothing, food, and other items from diverse cultures and ethnicities around the world. The 2.0 update wasn't the first time new inclusive hairstyles â€” last November, they added six Black hairstyles including puffs, an afro, and cornrows.</p>
            
            <img class="centerimg" src="images/suburbianewhairstyles.jpeg" alt="Picture of an Animal Crossing character sporting some of the new hairstyles brought in the ACNH 2.0 update. Hairstyles from left to right include: cornrows hair, hair with puffs, curly hair, short undercut, roundy hair, and bald. The curly bun hairstyle my character is wearing is not pictured here.">
            <img class="centerimg" src="images/suburbiapark.jpg" alt="My character is standing in front of Suburbia's playground in a royal blue Chinese traditional dress with a white umbrella.">
            
            <p>Incorporating increasingly diverse ways to customize your character shows that the ACNH developers are paying attention to fans' desire to be seen in the media they consume. As you can see, my character's been rocking the curly bun ever since I got it. It is refreshing to be able to make my character actually look like myself after years of "making do" with limited options. Seemingly small things like hairstyles and cultural dress can mean a lot to people who aren't used to seeing themselves in video games, and increase our sense of belonging in the gaming world.</p>

There is a wedding bell on the right side of the front yard, and a peach tree and clothesline on the right. Next to the right side of the yard, there is a brown wooden two-level deck; the bottom level has a white beach chair and the top level has a white tile pool.">
            <img src="images/suburbiaredhouse.jpg" alt="Aerial view of my character standing in front of a white house with a red roof. The house is on a cul-de-sac and has a lattice fence around it. Its yard has a rainbow inflatable pool, bamboo trees, and a pear tree. Across the street from the house is a small pumpkin patch.">

                <p>As the name suggests, Suburbia is modeled after a cookie-cutter suburban neighborhoods. Each house is in the same style and carefully placed along the main street in distinct neighborhoods. At first, I got all of the houses to be the same by looking up villagers with the house style I wanted and inviting them to my island. But thanks to the 2.0 update and the DLC add-on Happy Home Paradise, I am now able to customize my villager's houses, making it a million times easier to get the house styles I want.</p>
