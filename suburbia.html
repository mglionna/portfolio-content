"Suburbia is my third and most recent island, and by far my favorite so far! As I will mention below, the infamous Version 2.0 update brought a TON of new features that made the game even more enjoyable."

"One of my favorite features of the 2.0 update is that it brought in my new FAVORITE hairstyle! I finally got a hairstyle that looked like my natural curly hair texture. Over its lifetime, ACNH developers have steadily improved the inclusivity of the game by introducing hairstyles, clothing, food, and other items from diverse cultures and ethnicities around the world. The 2.0 update wasn't the first time new inclusive hairstyles — last November, they added six Black hairstyles including puffs, an afro, and cornrows.""

"With increasingly diverse ways to customize your character, it shows that the ACNH developers are paying attention to fans' desire to be seen in the media they consume. As you can see, my character's been rocking the curly bun ever since I got it.""   

Pictures: Houses

"As the name suggests, Suburbia is modeled after what might be called cookie-cutter suburban neighborhoods. Each house is in the same style and carefully placed along the main street in distinct neighborhoods. At first, I got all of the houses to be the same by looking up villagers with the house style I wanted and inviting them to my island. But thanks to the 2.0 update and the DLC add-on Happy Home Paradise, I am now able to customize my villager’s houses, making it a million times easier to get the house styles I want."
