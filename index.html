"About Me"

"Hi! My name is Meems and this is a website I made to document my journey through Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I started in April 2020 as a total newbie to the Animal Crossing franchise, and as of January 2022 I am now working on my fourth island in the game! As you can tell, my love for this game is still going strong and I am excited to share my process."
"Keep reading to learn about my journey in the game over the last 2 years, my creative process, and some of my favorite builds. Hopefully these can serve as a source of inspiration if you're stuck on ideas. With LOTS of features and decor options, New Horizons has creative options for everyone."
